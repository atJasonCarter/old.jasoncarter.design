        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns">The smart-home market is increasingly difficult to ignore. This is largely in part because of widespread adoption of the "Internet of Things" and aggressive buyouts of emerging smart home technology by large scale tech, such as Google taking over Nest in 2014. Our team of four was assigned to build out an all-in-one remote-control interface for the smart home.</p>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns">I learned early on in my career as a carpenter to measure thrice at every step of the process, and to evaluate when a piece was a failure as soon as possible to start over while not wasting resources. I focused on multiple iterations of all my sketches to gain experience and validate concepts quickly. I was also lucky to have gone to art school, bringing with me the experience of both accepting and dolling out realistic, honest and actionable criticism. </p>        
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns">Tasked with creating "A remote for all the smart objects in your house", we began research with three questions in mind:</p>
                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns q">What makes users want smarthome appliances <span>/</span> what drives them away?</p> 
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns q">What type of interface makes most sense to a user, and what have existing smarthome interfaces done to appeal adoption to the mass market?</p>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns q">How do we bridge the gap betweenthe growing smarthome market and the currently thinly-spread adoption by customers?</p>
        <div class="row space2"></div>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h3 class="nine columns"> Focus</h3>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>         <p class="nine columns">After <span>7</span> user interviews, we learned that our biggest barrier to entry was trust.  Users had a fear of their data being stolen or these technological improvements failing over traditional analog solutions. Our second issue to solve for was the need to make any smart tool easier than their analog counterparts. There was no need to integrate smarthome tech if it took just as long (or longer) to perform a task manually.</p>

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                 <h3 class="nine columns">Solution <span>#1</span></h3>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                        <p class="nine columns"> Our first design focused on building a dashboard where developers and product management would be able to quickly see panels including the data from: all running API plans, data-selections saved for future use, and planned/running/completed data-extracts. The app was partitioned so the users would navigate from these panels, into the correlating area</p> 
        </div>

                        <div class="foliobg">
                                            <img class="folio" src="/imgs/Dev Studio Dashboard v1.14 empty states.png" alt="Empty State Dashboard">

                        </div>  
        <div class="container">

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>             <p class="nine columns">Through testing and discussions with our backend development team I found two major issues with this solution; one business-oriented, and one user satisfaction: </p>
                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h5 class="nine columns space3"><strong>Issue</strong> <span class="h5">#1</span></h5>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>     <p class="nine columns">Based off the research I performed for our Jobs-to-be-done model, I came to the conclusion that a one-truth model of dashboard was unnecessary. Developers that are building apps only needed APIs, developers that are ordering extracts of data are only going to saved-selections and extracts. In addition to this, having all these panels simultaneously run calls from the same page would add unnecessary costs and load times to the dashboard.</p>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h5 class="nine columns space3"><strong>Issue</strong> <span class="h5">#2</span></h5>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>     <p class="nine columns">Users did not find the overly-minimalistic navigation from the panels intuitive. Developers wanted to be able to see all the options available to them, and ideally be able to use 'ctrl+f’ to immediately navigate around. </p>
         <div class="row space2">        

        </div>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <h3 class="nine columns">Solution <span>#2</span></h3>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <p class="nine columns">After our first round of testing I rebuilt our flow architecture to be more cognitively intuitive.  I removed the hamburger menu, and added a fixed, visible, side nav; a pattern that developers repeatedly mentioned was their ideal navigation flow for portals (this also matched our competitive analysis research). The new side nav included both parent and first-child pages, with the goal of making every page reachable in two clicks. I also created a marketing and landing page, that allowed our back-end to begin pre-loading calls to our data-lake. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="foliobg2">
                        <img class="folio" src="/imgs/N-step 2.png" alt="Empty State Dashboard">
                        <label class="foliot" for="Empty state dashboard"> Added fixed side Nav, updated typography, simplified copy</label>
    </div>  
    <div class="container">
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                                <p class="nine columns">To save loading time and visual-overload, I divided our dashboard into three individual pages; one for extracts, one for API management, and one for saved data selections. As a further speed enhancement our team decided to only initially show information on our dashboards that could be pulled from a maximum of 3 servers (instead of the 6 our first solution had). Progressive disclosure allowed us to show the remaining information in a pull-out drawer.</p>

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <p class="nine columns">We also developed governance and security features. These include fallback measures for developers that might accidentally write a recursive script to infinitely pull-data during an extract, warning users if the data in their saved-selection was altered, and If their API plan was on their final month of their plan.</p>

        <div class="two columns"><p> </p></div> <h3 class="nine columns">Wow, what a wild ride</h3>

                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>
        <p class="nine columns">With billions of rapidly refreshing different data points to filter through, Nielsens data can be a challenge to sort through. This is compounded by the fact that relying on humans to sort through the different, disaggregated data bases can takes days if not weeks. By enabling developers to take control of this process we compressed the timeline to minutes and hours.  To move forward, our goal with our developer studio was to make this process the easiest part of the developers day by using heuristic principles to make the process as intuitive as possible.  Both qualatative and quantitative testing allowed us to make quick data-driven decisions to best achieve these goals. We worked on a whole lot more enhancements, but I’ll have to tell you about them over a coffee meeting, my treat. 😉</p>
