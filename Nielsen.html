        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns">Nielsen specializes in big data analytics on what people across the world watch and buy. The way this data has been traditionally delivered is analog. As a solo designer for this product, I worked with Product Leadership to design a tool allowing developers to request vast amounts of data for analysis with speed and accuracy. </p>
                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <p class="nine columns">My key area of focus was identifying APIs developers wanted and needed to best perform their job, designing the navigation so developers would intuitively understand the tool, and designing the process for how developers and analysts select the data they need from our data-lakes.</p>
                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h3 class="nine columns"> My role</h3>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>         <p class="nine columns">I designed research plans and conducted exploratory research with developers to learn what they needed to make their lives easier and to be able to complete their jobs best. Then using the two-week sprint model, I executed High-Fidelity wireframes in Axure, Framer, and InVision to test potential solutions. <

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                        <p class="nine columns"> Our first design focused on building a dashboard where developers and product management would be able to quickly see panels including the data from: all running API plans, data-selections saved for future use, and planned/running/completed data-extracts. The app was partitioned so the users would navigate from these panels, into the correlating area</p>

                        </div>  
        <div class="container">

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>             <p class="nine columns">Through testing and discussions with our backend development team I found two major issues with this solution; one business-oriented, and one user satisfaction. </p>
                
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h5 class="nine columns"><strong>Issue</strong> <span class="h5">#1</span></h5>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>     <p class="nine columns">Based off the research I performed for our Jobs-to-be-done model, I came to the conclusion that a one-truth model of dashboard was unnecessary. Developers that are building apps only needed APIs, developers that are ordering extracts of data are only going to saved-selections and extracts. In addition to this, having all these panels simultaneously run calls from the same page would add unnecessary costs and load times to the dashboard.</p>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>        <h5 class="nine columns"><strong>Issue</strong> <span class="h5">#2</span></h5>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>     <p class="nine columns">Users did not find the overly-minimalistic navigation from the panels intuitive. Developers wanted to be able to see all the options available to them, and ideally be able to use 'ctrl+f’ to immediately navigate around. </p>
         <div class="row space2">        

        </div>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <h3 class="nine columns">Solution <span>#2</span></h3>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <p class="nine columns">After our first round of testing I rebuilt our flow architecture to be more cognitively intuitive.  I removed the hamburger menu, and added a fixed, visible, side nav; a pattern that developers repeatedly mentioned was their ideal navigation flow for portals (this also matched our competitive analysis research). The new side nav included both parent and first-child pages, with the goal of making every page reachable in two clicks. I also created a marketing and landing page, that allowed our back-end to begin pre-loading calls to our data-lake. </p>
        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                                <p class="nine columns">To save loading time and visual-overload, I divided our dashboard into three new dashboards each with their own dedicated pages; one for extracts, one for API management, and one for saved data selections. As a further speed enhancement our team decided to only initially show information on our dashboards that could be pulled from a maximum of 3 servers (instead of the 6 our first solution had). Progressive disclosure allowed us to show the remaining information in a pull-out drawer.</p>

        <div class="two columns"><p></p></div>                <p class="nine columns">We also developed governance and security features. These include fallback measures for developers that might accidentally write a recursive script to infinitely pull-data during an extract, warning users if the data in their saved-selection was altered, and If their API plan was on their final month of their plan.</p>
